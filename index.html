      <p>Hey, welcome to the about page. If you clicked this, it means you're either interested in me or you're just looking around the website. I'm BeeMilkz, bee, or just bee milk. I've been editing for Agamatsu since the start of 2024 and editing in general since 2019. This page will walk you through my journey as an editor, broken down into sections based on the different eras of my growth and experiences.</p>
      
      <h3>2019: The Beginning</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/40hJ-7NUy2k" target="_blank">first video</a>
 I ever edited (and posted publicly) was a shitpost. If you were on the internet around 2018, you might remember a YouTuber named Pyrocynical and the "so guys, we did it" meme from his subreddit. I made my own version with a simple Minecraft recording and the 250k subscriber special video. All I did was cut the video before I jumped in the water and added the 250k sub special on the timeline. That was it.</p>
      
      <p>My <a href="https://youtu.be/787oYf-lr1I" target="_blank">next upload</a>
 was another shitpost: it was an image of a chicken with Gorillaz's "Rock the House" playing over it. It then cut to black for a few seconds before transitioning to that one moaning sound effect with the Deez Nuts guy laughing.</p>
      
      <p>After that, I tried editing a more <a href="https://youtu.be/5PcvpLIiBgU" target="_blank">genuine video</a>
 of me playing Half-Life 2. It was simple: basic cuts, sound effects, and a couple of memes. Pretty boring, but this was the start of my actual editing. My next shitpost was a "<a href="https://youtu.be/mzu2dEmu3eU" target="_blank">train go boom</a>" meme, which was a meme back in 2015 when Black Ops 3 released.</p>
      
      <h3>2020: Experimentation</h3>
      <p>By 2020, I was still uploading shitposts. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZ9MQz2cO7g" target="_blank">One video</a>
 was me playing Garry's Mod with a friend. Another was me watching the <a href="https://youtu.be/YIwyDNVa_R8" target="_blank">Travis Scott concert</a>
 in Fortnite. For that one, I added the song names in the bottom-left corner and replaced the gameplay with someone else’s footage near the end because Xbox’s recording limit was only 10 minutes.</p>
      
      <p>Since the pandemic was happening, I had to get attached to something. I mean everyone did right? And that for me was Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2019. In my opinion, it’s the last Call of Duty worth playing. The campaign and multiplayer were good, though Spec Ops had its flaws. Multiplayer also had its flaws with shotgun users, campers, etc. Though I feel like that was all a skill issue. My favorite loadout was a riot shield, an R9-0 with Dragon’s Breath, and gas grenades. It pissed everyone off, but it was so much fun.</p>
      
      <p>Because I got attached to this game, I eventually got better and better since I played every day for multiple hours. as you've probably heard people say, practice makes perfect. The more you do something the more you get better at it. By playing daily, I improved a lot. Toward the end of 2020, I 1v2’ed my friend and his friend with snipers only and won. I turned the highlights into a <a href="https://youtu.be/3kUJintohNA" target="_blank">montage</a>
 with a <a href="https://youtu.be/Z_Y2qIS78II" target="_blank">Biggie Smalls mashup</a>. I edited it entirely on iMovie while lying in bed. If you're wondering why all the videos during this era are so low quality, it's because the editing software I was using at this time was Lightworks. they didn't allow you to export in 1080p, and the bitrate settings were locked behind a paywall. I think I found this editing software by watching a video named "top 10 free editing software for fortnite videos" or something along those lines.</p>
      
      <h3>2021: SusAlert</h3>
      <p>In 2021, I stopped uploading to my own channel and started editing for a parody channel I made with me and my friends called SusAlert, a parody of DramaAlert. Instead of reporting on celebrities, we made up absurd lies about our friends, like accusing them of touching kids. I was still using Lightworks during this time.</p>
      
      <h3>2022: Parodies</h3>
      <p>In 2022, I made one of my favorite videos: "<a href="https://youtu.be/nq2ZY3Adfz0" target="_blank">mlg epic phantom force montage!!!</a>" It was a parody of the 2000s/early 2010s montage style and was edited in Windows Movie Maker to make it authentic. Later that year, I made a montage of goofy moments from MW19 with a friend. This was only for me and him and it was my last video on Lightworks.</p>
      
      <p>Three days later, I switched to CapCut and made my first 1080p video: "<a href="https://youtu.be/sRjXlYFl03k" target="_blank">DEEPWOKEN FUNNY MOMENTS #1</a>," a parody of old funny moment compilations from the 2010s. It’s still one of my favorite videos.</p>
      
      <h3>2023: Obsession and Growth</h3>
      <p>The first video I uploaded in 2023 was a <a href="https://youtu.be/dYx9Wj5UaB4" target="_blank">shitpost</a>
 commemorating Tix (a parody). Around this time, I became obsessed with editing. CapCut’s interface made it easy to experiment, and I was editing something almost every week. Some videos were for YouTube, but many were funny videos for my friends on Discord.</p>
      
      <p>In February, I made "<a href="https://youtu.be/1JwjLGnNyoc" target="_blank">DEEPWOKEN FUNNY MOMENTS #2</a>," which I also loved but wished had better clips. A day later, I uploaded "<a href="https://youtu.be/upApoQcIpBE" target="_blank">How TRUSTWORTHY are DEEEPWOKEN players?</a>" This video was the first video I ever made that was genuinely trying to be a good video and interesting. Although staged, I had fun making it and it was a good way to practice and learn. It got 2k views in 24 hours, then jumped to 8k within a week, eventually peaking at 30k views. It was my first viral video. The comments were overwhelmingly positive, and it felt great.</p>
      
      <p>I tried to capitalize on the success with another video, "<a href="https://youtu.be/6QI0yM0v8zs" target="_blank">PRIMADON AND KAIDO IN SONGSEEKER</a>," but it didn’t perform well. The process of making it was painful. I was recording with my friend, who we were both exploiting at the time. Trying to get Kaido over to Songseeker was hard because he would just bug out. Same with Primadon. Eventually we did, but we barely got any footage because we would just record ourselves flying around. The video did not perform well. Still, I was glad to get it out.</p>
      
      <h3>The "System32" Troll Video</h3>
      <p>Three months later, I made a <a href="https://youtu.be/N92YVrnBwrU" target="_blank">video</a>
 that would troll people into bricking their computer by using a command in the command prompt. It deleted System32, and people actually believed it even with the bullshit I was talking about, the non existing confidence in my voice, and the shitty editing at the end. I was just yapping and talking about things that made no sense, yet people in the comments said I bricked their computer. Even in the description I said not to do it. This video also kind of gained traction. Not a lot as the trustworthy video, but it got 10k views. This was because at the time Synapse X wasn’t being updated due to roblox implementing anti-cheat into their game. Synapse X did not partner with roblox yet. People were desperate and looking for solutions. I decided to take this time to troll exploiters.</p>
      
      <h3>Late 2023: Synapse X and TikTok</h3>
      <p>In October, I made "<a href="https://youtu.be/CTy-IL3hSvE" target="_blank">R.I.P. Synapse X</a>," a tribute to the Roblox exploit tool that had been rendered useless because of Roblox’s anti-cheat. I just put images together and some text and put Charlie Puth’s “See You Again” over it. It was a shitpost, and not many people cared for it at first. I'm pretty sure it flat lined around a thousand views or so. 13 days later though, Roblox partnered with them, and my video skyrocketed to 10k views. My video aged like fine wine.</p>
      
      <p>In January 2024, I started editing for Agamatsu after he mentioned on stream that he was looking for TikTok editors. He just said "dm me a video if you wanna edit". I did. it was <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@agamatsuofficial/video/7328275493873274120" target="_blank">a TikTok</a>
 of when he told someone not to kill themselves because they would be missing out on Deepwoken. He enjoyed it and said "might be the best one ive seen, good shit" There were much more editors, like a lot more. But they would just make one TikTok and never make one again. I was the only one who was actually consistent and editing streams. I guess the others didn't expect it to be what they wanted it to be. All of them got kicked out of the editor Discord server. We had 2 orientations for new editors, and not a single one stayed. I Throughout 2024, I grew Agamatsu's TikTok; we got 10k followers, and the TikTok began getting money. To this day, I am still editing TikToks for him.</p>
      
      <h3>Early 2024</h3>
      <p>In April of 2024, I made a video titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/g5URM4fQLMY" target="_blank">THEY DENIED MY RESTORE???</a>
" which was a fake video of me doing my depths trial, and while I'm doing it, an earthquake strikes my house, which makes me wipe. This was, of course, fake. Around that time, an earthquake hit New Zealand, and I had the idea like, "what if I wiped on Deepwoken because of this earthquake." I did it, the video performed kinda meh. It got about a thousand views or so. No one called it out for being faked; the video is now unlisted because it's pretty cringe, in my opinion. Now throughout 2024, I wasn't really making any videos on my main channel because, well, I was busy editing for Agamatsu. The TikTok actually went into a hiatus in August though. This was because Deepwoken was dry at the time, and I was busy with school. However, we started them back up in September, and at this time, I switched over to Premiere Pro. This was because I didn't want to be held back by CapCut. CapCut is really powerful, but Premiere Pro is even better. I had always wanted to learn Premiere Pro; it just seemed so complicated to me. However, I remembered that practice makes perfect, and I made the switch.</p>
      
      <h3>Late 2024: Hurricane Milton</h3>
      <p>Preceding the next month, October 2024, at the start of the month, a hurricane formed named Hurricane Milton. I was hearing a lot about this hurricane all over, and I had the same idea I did last year about "what if a natural disaster wiped me." I got this idea from when I was scrolling on TikTok and came across a clip from Jynxzi where his window "broke" because of Hurricane Milton. It was actually just a fake sound clip, and he was clip farming.</p>
      
      <p>Anyway, hours later, I told my friend while we were playing Deepwoken that I had an idea. My pitch to him was something along the lines of, "Dude, what if I faked a video of Hurricane Milton blowing my roof while I was doing Ethiron or something and I was like, 'MY ROOOOOOF!'" He agreed, and we did it a couple of days later. I edited it in like 30 minutes or an hour, and <a href="https://youtu.be/kdSjZSZ2Ly4" target="_blank">I uploaded it</a>. For the first 24 hours, it only had 177 views. 20 days in, it only had 300. I didn't really care for this because I made the video just for my own enjoyment and to laugh at with my friends.</p>
      
      <p>However, on November 3rd, someone donated the video to Agamatsu, Agamatsu reacted to it, and the video started gaining traction. First, it was the livestream viewers coming to comment/watch. Then, one of the editors for Plugamatsu, Aneui, edited the segment from the stream into <a href="https://youtu.be/OQ8NKjnvKWQ" target="_blank">a video</a>. Then those people came to watch the video, and it skyrocketed to 12k views. Then the algorithm picked it up and pushed it out to everyone who watches Deepwoken, then it grew more and more, and it started pushing it out to Roblox players in general, and then it just started pushing it out to people who watch gaming. The video blew up. I was surprised, and I enjoyed reading the funny comments with my friends.</p>
      
      <p>However, people soon came to find out that the video was fake, and then came the comments with criticism. I replied to some to clarify things, but in the end, I didn't really care what they had to say. I thought it was funny, my friends thought it was funny, and that's all that mattered to me. I took advantage of this short-lived fame and made <a href="https://youtu.be/5-fik6sC7sI" target="_blank">a follow-up video</a>
 a month later detailing why I did it, how I did it, and answered some common questions. I answered common questions first, explained why I did it, and then the rest of the video was a long segment detailing every little piece of the video and how I edited the video. The like-to-dislike ratio is mixed, and the criticism and arguing in the comments were inevitable. There were people defending me, but also people hating on me. Honestly, I didn't pay attention to either. I just let people believe what they want.</p>
      
      <p>The truth is, I didn't even know the video would blow up, I didn't make money off it, my intention was never to "milk" the disaster or offend anyone, and I certainly didn't make it for clout. It was just a video I made for fun and to laugh at with my friends. Obviously, the video was too soon, and I'm not going to try and justify it by saying, "oh well, people made 9/11 jokes" or "this is just dark humor" or "I've done worse." Looking back, I cringe at myself for the follow-up video that I made. I got ahead of myself and thought people loved me. I was acting as if everyone suddenly gave a flying fuck about me and my channel, which just makes me cringe so badly. Nobody who engaged with that video did so because they "liked me" as a person. It's simply because they saw a poor guy playing Deepwoken getting hit by a Category 5 hurricane and were worried about his well-being/curious about the unusual situation and what the aftermath was.</p>
      
      <p>However, that's in the past. Looking back, I definitely cringe at the follow-up video. All my friends were telling me to continue making videos about it, but I didn't want to. I think I made the right choice. I didn't really care about it anymore, and if I made a third video, that would have just made me seem desperate and actually made it seem like I was milking it. I just wish people watched the video, found out it was fake, and moved on with themselves.</p>
      
      <h3>2024: December</h3>
      <p>After that video, a month later in December, I made <a href="https://youtu.be/U1W4uF_HINU" target="_blank">a video</a>
 that I am pretty proud of. I made it because I was tired of people getting me wiped and getting themselves wiped in Deepwoken because of one simple mistake. It was a video made to help people, and I hope it still is helping people.</p>
      
      <p>The latest video I have made is <a href="https://youtu.be/qq5vnp_5f-A" target="_blank">a parody</a>
 of Agamatsu's video where he explains the Deepwoken iceberg. In my parody, I talk about things that are well-known rather than underground. In my opinion, the parody is pretty accurate. It was for Agamatsu's Slopathton, which was a challenge where you made a 1-2 minute video on something Deepwoken-related. The winner won a cash prize of $100, and the video would be rated by judges 0/10.</p>
      
      <h3>Present Day</h3>
      <p>Now, I’m still editing TikToks for Agamatsu and occasionally working on my own projects. My editing has improved immensely. Just take a look at my <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@agamatsuofficial/video/7328275493873274120" target="_blank">first TikTok</a>
 vs my <a href="https://youtu.be/U1W4uF_HINU" target="_blank">thresher video</a>. (1 year difference!)</p>
      
      <p>Thanks for reading, or maybe you just scrolled all the way to the bottom. That’s okay too. Either way, I hope this gave you insight into my journey as an editor. :-)</p>
